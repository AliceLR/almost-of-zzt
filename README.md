# The Almost of ZZT

Against all odds, this is a near-complete copy of an actual development version of ZZT's source code, dating to June 12th-19th, 1991. It appears to be very close to ZZT 3.0.
This is not a decompilation! This is the real deal... well, *almost*.

It is not an exact copy of this development version - components suspected to be the copyright of third parties have been removed.
Where it was not possible to revert them without compromising the historical nature of the repository, they were adequately annotated with `{ REMOVED - Suspected third-party copyright }`.
If the rights to distribute these missing components are granted, the repository will be updated to match.

The following files are untouched and, to the best of my knowledge, fully authentic:

```
GAME/EDIT.PAS
GAME/FASTWR.PAS
GAME/GAMECTRL.PAS
GAME/KEYBOARD.PAS
GAME/LANG.PAS
GAME/SOUNDU.PAS
HELP/ZZTHLP.PAS
```

The remaining `.PAS` files have received minor alterations as described above.

Please treat this repository as a historical record, or as close to one as I can legally release at this time.
**If you're looking for a version of ZZT's source code which is complete, based on the latest version of ZZT, ready to compile, clear of copyright worries, and recommended to use for development,
I recommend the [Reconstruction of ZZT](https://github.com/asiekierka/reconstruction-of-zzt) instead.**

As with the Reconstruction of ZZT, I have received Epic's permission to release this code under the MIT license.

Special thanks to Tim Sweeney for supporting the ZZT community's endeavours throughout the years.
